## Getting Started
First, make a copy of ".env.local.template" and rename to ".env.local". 

Next update ".env.local" with applicable enviromental variables. 

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
