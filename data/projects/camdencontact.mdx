[Camden.contact](http://Camden.contact) is a virtual business card that allows the user to see my contact information and send their contact information. 

## Inspiration:

Back when I was interning at [Tour.Video](http://Tour.Video) by LeaseMagnets I was apart of a project to build a two way contact exchange into the TourMagnet. This was going to be a part of the demo at an upcoming conference. At the end of a demo the user would be prompted for their information and then be show the screen below where they are able to download the VCF contact file. 

This inspired me to build [Camden.contact](http://Camden.contact) as a prototype of a virtual business card supporting contact sharing in both directions. A demo of the TourMagnets two way contact exchange can be found [here](https://embed.tour.video?uuid=5d25b3c0-19bc-40ff-a0d3-762ccfb7cdc9&inline=true&screen=floor_plans.form_screen&inlineCTA=Take%20a%20tour&hideButtons=false&tourMsg=undefined) (Note: this feature is not currently maintained by [Tour.Video](http://Tour.Video) and may not function as intended).

## Implementation:

Currently [Camden.contact](http://Camden.contact) is built using create-react-app and Firebase storage. When a contact is submitted it is added to the Firebase and must be retrieved manually. Future plans for [Camden.contact](http://Camden.contact) are to improve performance by transitioning to using Next.js and sending an email to the site owner when a contact form is submitted.
